🌨 Risk 1: Road Closure / Heavy Snow
📊 Probability: 20% | Impact: €300 | Severity: Medium
🛡 Mitigation: Monitor weather forecasts 48 hours before departure, equip van with mandatory snow chains, depart Budapest at 05:00 AM for time buffer, identify alternate routes via Fernpass.
👤 Responsible: Khatsady (Navigator)

🚑 Risk 2: Ski Injury / Medical Emergency 
📊 Probability: 10% | Impact: €1,500 | Severity: HIGH
🛡 Mitigation: Mandatory winter sports insurance for all 4 members covering helicopter rescue up to €10,000 and medical expenses up to €50,000. Pre-save emergency numbers: Mountain Rescue 140, Emergency 112. Carry digital insurance cards in phones. Ski within ability level, avoid off-piste without guide.
👤 Responsible: Antsa (Insurance Verification)

🚗 Risk 3: Vehicle Damage
📊 Probability: 15% | Impact: €800 | Severity: Medium
🛡 Mitigation: Purchase 'Zero Excess' full insurance waiver from Europcar eliminating all damage fees, pre-trip vehicle inspection with photos, designated driver rotation to prevent fatigue, avoid tight mountain parking.
👤 Responsible: Bounsouthathip (Logistics Lead)

💸 Risk 4: Dining Budget Overrun
📊 Probability: 40% | Impact: €200 | Severity: Low

📊 Probability: 15% | Impact: €100 | Severity: Low
